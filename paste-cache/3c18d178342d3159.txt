We are trying to solve the process for 1099 reps on the Dax side to easily input orders. Thoughts are an email to a centralized distro group for us to input manually, but we also are thinking about a simple form fill site (ex: google forms) that would map to OrderCircle via their APIs. This keeps these 1099 reps out of the software, but gives them ability to input orders on their own. 



Considerations:

Keep 1099 reps out of the OrderCircle software
Simplify and automate as much of this as possible so we aren't creating a bottleneck to import orders manually
1099 reps will need customer order emails and shipping emails when marked shipped to manage their customers easily
I've already reached out to Hasan asking about linking a rep to all customer emails so I will provide you with the response once he comes back


OrderCircle APIs:

The APIs are available in the Platinum subscription tier (we are on the mid-tier right now)
If you can find the documentation for the APIs or ask Hasan for the documentation, we can gauge if this is a viable path before upgrading subscription
We might be able to access the higher tier for a trial period to do some testing - please ask Hasan if we can do this if you think this will work
