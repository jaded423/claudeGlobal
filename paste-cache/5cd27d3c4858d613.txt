I'm setting up automated photo syncing from Google Drive to Apple Shared Albums for my team.

BACKGROUND:
- Staff uses Google Workspace and uploads photos to "Elevated Trading, LLC" Shared Drive
- Staff all have iPhones and want photos in their native Photos app via a Shared Album
- My Mac is online during business hours and can run automation
- Google Drive Desktop doesn't support mirroring Shared Drives, only streaming

WHAT WE'VE BUILT:
- Created ~/scripts/crawler/crawler.py that:
  - Walks the entire "Elevated Trading, LLC" Shared Drive
  - Reads 32KB from each file to trigger Google Drive download
  - Runs via cron every 15 minutes during business hours: */15 9-18 * * 1-5
  - Logs to ~/scripts/crawler/crawler.log
  - No delay between files for maximum speed

CURRENT STATUS:
- Just expanded crawler from single "Product Pics and Vids" folder to entire Shared Drive
- Running first full crawl now (possibly 5,000-10,000 files)
- Not sure if it's working - need to verify process is running and making progress

NEXT STEPS (after crawler is working):
1. Verify all Shared Drive files are downloaded locally
2. Create second script that:
   - Watches "Product Pics and Vids" folder specifically
   - Detects new photos/videos
   - Uses AppleScript to import to Photos app
   - Adds them to a specific Shared Album
   - All staff iPhones will see updates automatically

IMMEDIATE HELP NEEDED:
- Verify crawler.py is running correctly
- Check progress of current crawl
- Debug if stuck/crashed
