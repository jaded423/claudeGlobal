## Project Overview

This directory serves as a repository for defining and instructing various AI agents that can be utilized by Claude. Each Markdown file (`.md`) within this directory outlines the capabilities, methodology, and usage examples for a specific agent, enabling Claude to understand when and how to deploy these specialized tools.

## Key Files

*   `gemini-researcher.md`: Defines an AI agent focused on general web-based research using Gemini's headless mode. It outlines the agent's research methodology, query formulation best practices, and output guidelines.
*   `orchestrator.md`: (Assuming its content based on name) Likely defines an agent responsible for coordinating or managing other agents or complex workflows.
*   `security-auditor.md`: (Assuming its content based on name) Likely defines an agent specialized in security auditing tasks, identifying vulnerabilities, or assessing security postures.
*   `ultimate-researcher.md`: An enhanced and more robust version of the `gemini-researcher` agent, designed for highly efficient, powerful, and token-optimized web searches using Gemini. It emphasizes advanced query formulation, intelligent synthesis, and rigorous quality assurance.

## Usage

These agent definition files are intended to provide Claude with the necessary context and instructions to effectively utilize each specialized AI agent. When Claude encounters a user request that aligns with an agent's capabilities, it can refer to the corresponding `.md` file to understand how to invoke the agent, formulate appropriate queries, and interpret its output. This setup allows Claude to extend its functionality by leveraging external, specialized AI tools for specific tasks like web research, security auditing, or complex task orchestration.
